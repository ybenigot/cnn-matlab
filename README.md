This repository uses code adapted from stanford dl ex exercises, but goes farther, implementing a convnet with hyperparameters.

Please note : this is only trial software, not maintained open source, so do not use it for anything more than reading.

If you are looking for a good convnet I suggest you try Theano as this matlab implementation is not optimal.
